This repository contains scripts required to setting up a service on a ubuntu system and creating a web app to monitor the service remotely 
over Network . The Network consists of 2 Users, where the services are installed and running and 1 Service Administrator that remotely checks 
if the service is running or not , This method can be used to check for resource avaiblability on web servers .  The system administrator has 
a web app that contains a html page that inputs 'i' number of seconds and an Update button . The web app pings the other two systems after 'i' seconds
and check if server is online and if the service is running or not.
